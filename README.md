# Lucas' random scripts
I created this repo with the goal of saving random utility scripts I use to sort through my own files. Namely:
- `sort_fuji.py`: Quickly sort through JPEG and RAW files produced by my Fuji camera. Press `k` to keep both, `j` to keep the JPEG only and `d` to delete both.
- `sort_samples.py`: Quickly classify and sort through [Splice](https://splice.com) music samples and put then into my tidied "Splice sorted" samples folder.

Use at your own risk :)
